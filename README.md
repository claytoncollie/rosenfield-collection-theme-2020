# Rosenfield Collection Theme

## Installation

Install dependencies and build the assets:

```shell
composer install && npm install && npm run build
```

## Usage

Static assets are organized in the `assets` directory. This folder contains theme scripts, styles, images, fonts, views and language translation files. All of the main theme styles are contained in the `assets/css/main.css` file, the `style.css` file at the root of the theme is left blank intentionally and only contains the required stylesheet header comment.
